      <h3>This app determines best travel destinations based on the month a user would like to vacation and the type of experience desired. After selecting your specific criteria, you'll be presented with a list of suggested destinations. Along with each city is a gallery of pictures and brief explanation. <br> The database of destinations was hand-created by me, after years of extensive travel research and my own travel experiences. There are currently around 70 destinations in the database, and I plan to keep adding more. </h3>
