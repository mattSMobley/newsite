  <h1 class="pageTitle"> MARSEILLE, FRANCE </h1>
  <h3 class="summary"> Marseille is France's second city. Still with a population of under a million, Marseille is about twice as big as any other city in France, aside from Paris. It has always been an important port and harbor, and today its Vieux Port (the Old Port) is still a very charming area, and a hot spot for activity. Marseille's long history of wealth is evident throughout the city. One of the more underrated aspects of Marseille, in my opinion, is the proximity to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=calanques&safe=off&espv=2&biw=1247&bih=745&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQ6rD83PzLAhVD-mMKHWcqA3oQ_AUIBygC#q=calanques&safe=off&tbm=isch&tbs=isz:lt,islt:xga">calanques</a>. A calanque is a narrow, steep-walled inlet that was developed in limestone or dolimite, and it is where the locals like to go to escape the city, sunbathe, and take in amazing views.</h3>

      <p>VIEUX PORT </p>
      <img src="https://matterri.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/img_6718.jpg" class="blog-img">
      <h3 class="captions"> Vieux Port, which means Old Port, is probably the most popular attraction in Marseille, and with good reason. It's such a great area for strolling, enjoying a happy hour on the terrace, and exploring around.</h3>

      <h3 class="captions"> An old ship here has been turned into a tourist attraction.</h3>

      <h3 class="captions"> Another view of the magestic Vieux Port. </h3>

      <img src="https://matterri.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/img_1782.jpg" class="blog-img">
      <h3 class="captions"> This was a popular scene in Southern France: locals a tourist gathered around a breakdance battle. </h3>

      <img src="https://matterri.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/img_6719.jpg" class="blog-img">
      <h3 class="captions"> There are plenty of places nearby to grab some appropriately-sized drinks along with the complimentary olives and nuts(VERY Mediterranean). </h3>

      <p>SOME VIEWS AROUND TOWN</p>
      <img src="https://matterri.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/img_1789.jpg" class="blog-img">
      <h3 class="captions"> I always like to get a few pictures of impressive buildings or great views to remember the city by. </h3>

      <img src="https://matterri.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/img_1824.jpg" class="blog-img">
      <h3 class="captions"> Another typical Southern French building. </h3>

      <img src="https://matterri.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/img_1793.jpg" class="blog-img">
      <h3 class="captions"> And sometimes I include myself just so my family believes I went there. </h3>


      <p>CALANQUE DE NIOLON</p>
      <img src="https://matterri.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/img_1798.jpg" class="blog-img">
      <h3 class="captions"> Calanque De Niolon is one of the closest calanques to Marseille. There are perhaps better ones, but for a 35 min train ride, it was more than adequate. </h3>

      <img src="https://matterri.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/img_1797.jpg" class="blog-img">
      <h3 class="captions"> There were maybe 50ish people spread out around the entire calanque. We brought a few beers, some Caprice Des Dieux(which you HAVE to try if you got to a French supermarket), and some Bonne Maman jam. There aren't a ton of shops nearby so make sure to prepare well. </h3>
