  <h1 class="pageTitle"> MONTPELLIER, FRANCE </h1>
  <h3 class="summary"> Whenever I'm asked to describe Montpellier, the phrase that usually comes to mine is "spring break all year." There is an abundance of youth in Montpellier. They picnic and go to the beach during the day, and eat long meals and have drinks in the Place de Comedie (center of town) at night. Montpellier isn't really a place to go for sightseeing, but it has some of the best small-city <i>ambiance</i> in Europe.</h3>

      <h3 class="captions"> As is the case in France and Spain, meals are usually several courses and are meant to be enjoyed over a couple of hours. Not a hard thing to do in such a cool place. </h3>
