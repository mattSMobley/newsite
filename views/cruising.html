      <h1> CRUISING </h1>
    </div>

    <h3 class="summary"> I've been on a handful of Caribbean cruises and two transatlantic cruises. I've always loved cruises, I think you get a lot for your money. But transatlantic cruises are another story. Both of the transatlantic cruises I've been on were under $500 per ticket. Not only is that less than the price of a one-way flight to Europe, but you also get to go to several amazing ports, get gourmet food, maid service, and a lot of time to relax/tan/work-out/read/etc. </h3>
