  <h1>
    A MAN AND A WORLD
  </h1>
  <br><br><br>
  <p class="intro">As a child, I had the world surrounding my room in the form of wallpaper. In high school, the only homework I actually did was Geography. And in college, I was completely enthralled with foreign cultures. Finally in 2011, I moved to Houston, TX, met the love of my life, and we started traveling the world.
  <br><br><br>
  Anyway, this is not a love story about a man and a woman. Itâ€™s a love story about a man and a world. </p>
