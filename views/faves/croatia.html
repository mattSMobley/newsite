  <h1 class="pageTitle"> DUBROVNIK AND NEARBY ISLANDS</h1>
  <h3 class="summary"> Dubrovnik is a rugged, hilly town that houses about 45,000 people. However small the population of Dubrovnik is, the tourist numbers keep increasing each year, making Dubrovnik more and more into a Adriatic resort town. It's no surprise people keep
    coming to Dubrovnik, though. With it's abundance of stunning scenery, relaxing beaches, and historic Old City, there is a lot to be seen in Dubrovnik.
    <br> In my experience in Dubrovnik, I found the locals to be overwhelmingly welcoming. Though you may not receive the best service in the highly concentrated tourist spots(which is pretty much true anywhere), head a few blocks outside of the Old City
    and you can find several places to eat, drink, or shop with more-than-reasonable prices and gracious hosts. The whole town of Dubrovnik only takes 15-20 minutes to ride around on a moped, and it is definitely worth discovering. If you have the time,
    I suggest taking a ferry to one of the nearby islands for a more low-key type of experience. There are sandy beaches, hidden waterfalls, trails and other adventures waiting for you on islands like Kolocep, Lokrum and Lopud. </h3>

    <h3 class="captions"> On the left is the island of Lokrum. On the right is Dubrovnik's Old City. Most of the buildings have bright-orange roofs since the original roofs were destroyed during the 1990s armed conflict.</h3>

    <h3 class="captions"> Another view of Old City but from the south side this time. I took this picture while stopped at an intersection in a moped. If you visit Dubrovnik, make sure to rent a scooter. It will help you get to some amazing views.</h3>

    <h3 class="captions"> Old City Dubrovnik in late afternoon. There are a lot of tourists traps in this area, because of the high volume of visitors, but it is an amazing place to walk around and take in views.</h3>

    <h3 class="captions"> This is another shot from the Hotel Stari Grad Restaurant in Old City. It is one of the pricier restaurants around but the views are unmatched. Our food was excellent as well.</h3>

    <h3 class="captions"> A shot facing south of the Old City. This was also taken on my scooter ride around Dubrovnik.</h3>

    <h3 class="captions"> This a picture of one of the iconic Dubrovnik sunsets while leaving Lopud, an island near Dubrovnik. There are several ferries between Dubrovnik, Kolocep and Lopud. If you like sandy beaches, Lopud is likely a place you might want to visit.</h3>



    <img src="https://matterri.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_2724.jpg" class="blog-img">
    <h3 class="captions"> Kolocep is another one of the beautiful islands near Dubrovnik, and it's on the same ferry route. Crystal clear water, beaches, and a relaxed atmosphere are some of the reasons to visit this little island.</h3>
